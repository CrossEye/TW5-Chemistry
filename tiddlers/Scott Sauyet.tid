Scott Sauyet is a father, husband, and soon-to-be grandfather (!!) who lives on a horse farm in Connecticut, USA, with one turtle, two dogs, four cats, nineteen horses, his wife, and some number of children that he's never been able to pin down without tanks, cages, crates, or stalls to keep them still.  He is also a nature-lover, a serious reader, a juggler, a chess-player, and a lover of puzzles.  He's a proud supporter of the [[Oxford Comma|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma]] (and shouldn't we all be?)

He is employed as a Software Architect for one of those gigantic insurance companies that litter the Hartford area.  He's still a coder at heart, and spends a fair bit of time on open-source projects, most notably the Javascript functional programming library, [[Ramda|https://ramdajs.com]].
