Manganese sulfate can be used as a fungicide.","wikipedia-link":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese","year":"1774"},"Meitnerium":{"title":"Meitnerium","atomic-mass":"268","atomic-number":"109","atomic-radius":"","boiling-point":"","created":"20230419034107079","density":"35","discoverer":"GSI, Darmstadt, West Germany","electronegativity":"","element":"Meitnerium","element-type":"Transactinide","first-ionization":"","group":"9","melting-point":"","metal":"yes","metalloid":"no","modified":"20230419034107079","natural":"no","non-metal":"no","number-of-electrons":"109","number-of-isotopes":"","number-of-neutrons":"159","number-of-protons":"109","number-of-shells":"7","number-of-valence":"","period":"7","phase":"artificial","radioactive":"yes","specific-heat":"","symbol":"Mt","tags":"[[Chemical Element]]","wikipedia-extract":"Meitnerium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Mt and atomic number 109.
