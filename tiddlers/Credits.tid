Although so far, the bulk of the work on this project has been done by [[Scott Sauyet]], a great number of people have offered ideas, encouragement, and a massive amounts of technical help.  Before this is spread beyond the TiddlyWiki community, we will try to collect a list of names of those people.  But even before that, there are two that I must mention right away:

  * [[Jeremy Ruston|https://github.com/Jermolene]] created and continues to maintain [[TiddlyWiki]], an amazing tool that lets us build such things as a personal Periodic Table wiki... and //so// much more.

  * [[TÃ©lumire|https://github.com/Telumire]] offered the suggestion for the [[Reactor|Periodic Table with Reactor]], as well as much of the code that it uses as well as in-depth technical help and encouragement.
