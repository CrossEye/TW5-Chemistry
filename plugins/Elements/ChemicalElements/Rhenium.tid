wikipedia-extract: Rhenium is a chemical element with the symbol Re and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-gray, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table. With an estimated average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust. Rhenium has the third-highest melting point and second-highest boiling point of any element at 5869 K. Rhenium resembles [[manganese|Manganese]] and [[technetium|Technetium]] chemically and is mainly obtained as a by-product of the extraction and refinement of [[molybdenum|Molybdenum]] and [[copper|Copper]] ores. Rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.
