wikipedia-extract: Tellurium is a chemical element with the symbol Te and atomic number 52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, [[silver|Silver]]-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to [[selenium|Selenium]] and [[sulfur|Sulfur]], all three of which are chalcogens. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the Universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of [[platinum|Platinum]], is due partly to its formation of a volatile hydride that caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of Earth.
