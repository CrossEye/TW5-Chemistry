wikipedia-extract: Aluminium is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13. Aluminium has a density lower than those of other common metals; about one-third that of steel. It has a great affinity towards [[oxygen|Oxygen]], forming a protective layer of oxide on the surface when exposed to air. Aluminium visually resembles [[silver|Silver]], both in its color and in its great ability to reflect light. It is soft, nonmagnetic and ductile. It has one stable isotope: 27Al, which is highly abundant, making aluminium the twelfth-most common element in the universe. The radioactivity of 26Al is used in radiometric dating.
