wikipedia-extract: Francium is a chemical element with the symbol Fr and atomic number 87. It is extremely radioactive; its most stable isotope, francium-223, has a half-life of only 22Â minutes. It is the second-most electropositive element, behind only caesium, and is the second rarest naturally occurring element. The isotopes of francium decay quickly into [[astatine|Astatine]], [[radium|Radium]], and [[radon|Radon]]. The electronic structure of a francium atom is [Rn] 7s1, and so the element is classed as an alkali metal.
