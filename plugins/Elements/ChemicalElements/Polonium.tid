wikipedia-extract: Polonium is a chemical element with the symbol Po and atomic number 84. A rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes, polonium is a chalcogen and is chemically similar to [[selenium|Selenium]] and [[tellurium|Tellurium]], though its metallic character resembles that of its horizontal neighbors in the periodic table: [[thallium|Thallium]], [[lead|Lead]], and [[bismuth|Bismuth]]. Due to the short half-life of all its isotopes, its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium-210 in [[uranium|Uranium]] ores, as it is the penultimate daughter of natural [[uranium|Uranium]]-238. Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist, they are much more difficult to produce. Today, polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the neutron irradiation of [[bismuth|Bismuth]]. Due to its intense radioactivity, which results in the radiolysis of chemical bonds and radioactive self-heating, its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only.
