wikipedia-extract: Niobium is a chemical element with chemical symbol Nb and atomic number 41. It is a light grey, crystalline, and ductile transition metal. Pure niobium has a Mohs hardness rating similar to pure [[titanium|Titanium]], and it has similar ductility to [[iron|Iron]]. Niobium oxidizes in Earth's atmosphere very slowly, hence its application in jewelry as a hypoallergenic alternative to [[nickel|Nickel]]. Niobium is often found in the minerals pyrochlore and columbite, hence the former name "columbium". Its name comes from Greek mythology: Niobe, daughter of Tantalus, the namesake of [[tantalum|Tantalum]]. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties, which makes them difficult to distinguish.
