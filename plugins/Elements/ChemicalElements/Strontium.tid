wikipedia-extract: Strontium is the chemical element with the symbol Sr and atomic number 38. An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a soft [[silver|Silver]]-white yellowish metallic element that is highly chemically reactive. The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air. Strontium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, [[calcium|Calcium]] and [[barium|Barium]]. It occurs naturally mainly in the minerals celestine and strontianite, and is mostly mined from these.
