wikipedia-extract: Selenium is a chemical element with the symbol Se and atomic number 34. It is a nonmetal with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below in the periodic table, [[sulfur|Sulfur]] and [[tellurium|Tellurium]], and also has similarities to [[arsenic|Arsenic]]. It seldom occurs in its elemental state or as pure ore compounds in the Earth's crust. Selenium – from Greek selḗnē – was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously discovered [[tellurium|Tellurium]].
