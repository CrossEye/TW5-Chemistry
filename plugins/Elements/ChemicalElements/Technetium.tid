wikipedia-extract: Technetium is a chemical element with the symbol Tc and atomic number 43. It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive. All available technetium is produced as a synthetic element. Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous fission product in [[uranium|Uranium]] ore and [[thorium|Thorium]] ore, the most common source, or the product of neutron capture in [[molybdenum|Molybdenum]] ores. This silvery gray, crystalline transition metal lies between [[manganese|Manganese]] and [[rhenium|Rhenium]] in group 7 of the periodic table, and its chemical properties are intermediate between those of both adjacent elements. The most common naturally occurring isotope is 99Tc, in traces only.
