wikipedia-extract: Osmium is a chemical element with the symbol Os and atomic number 76. It is a hard, brittle, bluish-white transition metal in the [[platinum|Platinum]] group that is found as a trace element in alloys, mostly in [[platinum|Platinum]] ores. Osmium is the densest naturally occurring element. When experimentally measured using X-ray crystallography, it has a density of 22.59Â g/cm3. Manufacturers use its alloys with [[platinum|Platinum]], [[iridium|Iridium]], and other [[platinum|Platinum]]-group metals to make fountain pen nib tipping, electrical contacts, and in other applications that require extreme durability and hardness.
