wikipedia-extract: Radon is a chemical element with the symbol Rn and atomic number 86. It is a radioactive, colourless, odourless, tasteless noble gas. It occurs naturally in minute quantities as an intermediate step in the normal radioactive decay chains through which [[thorium|Thorium]] and [[uranium|Uranium]] slowly decay into various short-lived radioactive elements and [[lead|Lead]]. Radon itself is the immediate decay product of [[radium|Radium]]. Its most stable isotope, 222Rn, has a half-life of only 3.8 days, making it one of the rarest elements. Since [[thorium|Thorium]] and [[uranium|Uranium]] are two of the most common radioactive elements on Earth, while also having three isotopes with half-lives on the order of several billion years, radon will be present on Earth long into the future despite its short half-life. The decay of radon produces many other short-lived nuclides, known as "radon daughters", ending at stable isotopes of [[lead|Lead]].
