wikipedia-extract: Boron is a chemical element with the symbol B and atomic number 5. In its crystalline form it is a brittle, dark, lustrous metalloid; in its amorphous form it is a brown powder. As the lightest element of the boron group it has three valence electrons for forming covalent bonds, resulting in many compounds such as boric acid, the mineral [[sodium|Sodium]] borate, and the ultra-hard crystals of boron carbide and boron nitride.
