wikipedia-extract: Cobalt is a chemical element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27. As with [[nickel|Nickel]], cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric [[iron|Iron]]. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, [[silver|Silver]] metal.
