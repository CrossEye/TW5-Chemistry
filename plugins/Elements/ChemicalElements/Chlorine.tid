wikipedia-extract: Chlorine is a chemical element with the symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between [[fluorine|Fluorine]] and [[bromine|Bromine]] in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity on the revised Pauling scale, behind only [[oxygen|Oxygen]] and [[fluorine|Fluorine]].
