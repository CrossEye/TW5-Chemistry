wikipedia-extract: Tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol Ta and atomic number 73. Previously known as tantalium, it is named after Tantalus, a figure in Greek mythology. Tantalum is a very hard, ductile, lustrous, blue-gray transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant. It is part of the refractory metals group, which are widely used as components of strong high-melting-point alloys. It is a group 5 element, along with [[vanadium|Vanadium]] and [[niobium|Niobium]], and it always occurs in geologic sources together with the chemically similar [[niobium|Niobium]], mainly in the mineral groups tantalite, columbite and coltan.
