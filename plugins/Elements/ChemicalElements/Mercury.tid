wikipedia-extract: Mercury is a chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is also known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum from the Greek words hydorcode: ell promoted to code: el  (water) and argyroscode: ell promoted to code: el  ([[silver|Silver]]). A heavy, silvery d-block element, mercury is the only metallic element that is known to be liquid at standard temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is the halogen [[bromine|Bromine]], though metals such as caesium, [[gallium|Gallium]], and [[rubidium|Rubidium]] melt just above room temperature.
