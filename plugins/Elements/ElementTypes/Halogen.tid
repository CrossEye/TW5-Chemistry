> The halogens are a group in the periodic table consisting of six chemically related elements: [[fluorine|Fluorine]] (F), [[chlorine|Chlorine]] (Cl), [[bromine|Bromine]] (Br), [[iodine|Iodine]] (I), [[astatine|Astatine]] (At), and [[tennessine|Tennessine]] (Ts), though some authors would exclude [[tennessine|Tennessine]] as its chemistry is unknown and is theoretically expected to be more like that of [[gallium|Gallium]]. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, this group is known as group 17.
