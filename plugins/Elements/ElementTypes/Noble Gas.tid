wikipedia-extract: The noble gases make up a class of chemical elements with similar properties; under standard conditions, they are all odorless, colorless, monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity. The six naturally occurring noble gases are [[helium|Helium]] (He), [[neon|Neon]] (Ne), [[argon|Argon]] (Ar), [[krypton|Krypton]] (Kr), [[xenon|Xenon]] (Xe), and the radioactive [[radon|Radon]] (Rn).
