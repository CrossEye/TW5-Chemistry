wikipedia-extract: Superheavy elements, also known as transactinide elements, transactinides, or super-heavy elements, are the chemical elements with atomic number greater than 103. The superheavy elements are those beyond the actinides in the periodic table; the last actinide is [[lawrencium|Lawrencium]]. By definition, superheavy elements are also transuranium elements, i.e., having atomic numbers greater than that of [[uranium|Uranium]] (92). Depending on the definition of group 3 adopted by authors, [[lawrencium|Lawrencium]] may also be included to complete the 6d series.
